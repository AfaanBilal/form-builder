## Introduction
**AMX Form Builder** is a web app that helps users create simple HTML forms with 
PHP backend using simple drag-n-drop. The generated PHP file (yes, just *one* file) 
may be uploaded on any PHP-enabled web server. The submitted form data will be stored 
in a CSV file in the same directory as the php file.
